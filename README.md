# hello-world
My first repository. Learning with The Odin Project. Feels nice. I'm a computer science student from Dominincan Republic. I study at PUCMM. I haven't found which thing I like the most about programming because there is too many. I'm loving web dev. Started programming with C++ and went all the way to assembly.
